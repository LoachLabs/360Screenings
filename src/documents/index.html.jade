        **[360 Screenings](http://360screenings.com)** provides a cinematic
         experience that audiences not only watch but also become a part of
         through live theatre installations. Every event features an interactive
         live performance followed by a film screening. The location of the venue,
         a *Toronto* heritage or unique building, is kept secret until 24 hours
         prior to the screening, and the film itself isnâ€™t revealed until the
         second half of the evening. A hybrid between live theatre and cinema, the
         audience is encouraged to explore, uncover and interact with the actors
         and set design.
