            **[360 Screenings](http://360screenings.com)** provides a cinematic
            experience that audiences not only watch but also become a part of
            through live theatre installations. Every event features an interactive
            live performance followed by a film screening. The location of the venue,
            a *Toronto* heritage or unique building, is kept secret until 24 hours
            prior to the screening, and the film itself isnâ€™t revealed until the
            second half of the evening. A hybrid between live theatre and cinema, the
            audience is encouraged to explore, uncover and interact with the actors
            and set design.
